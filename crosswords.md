I publish American-style crosswords on my [Crosshare](https://crosshare.org/noneuclidean) blog. Here are some of the good ones:<br>
- [A Generic Tall Crossword](https://crosshare.org/crosswords/E3ZcTKTP7GQDIyqZgWpK/a-generic-tall-crossword), a normal crossword.<br>
- [Broken printer](https://crosshare.org/crosswords/lJMSLpTSIRge77ZSj4SN/broken-printer), an abnormal crossword<br>

- [Safe Cracking](https://crosshare.org/crosswords/ukxV734V4ZETqDehJkgP/safe-cracking), a puzzle about deducing a code.<br>
- [Clairvoyance](https://crosshare.org/crosswords/zepzQgwWfs8ZmkeJd5wt/clairvoyance), a puzzle where I read your mind.<br>
- [Fill in the Blanks](https://crosshare.org/crosswords/DhKXvP0AaqYCWD0hnIkD/fill-in-the-blanks), a puzzle where you fill in the blanks

If you're familiar with [metas](https://crosshare.org/articles/meta-crossword-puzzles), I have a few of those too.<br>

- [Natural Order](https://crosshare.org/crosswords/LqYcET87da1ZegN8E2g2/natural-order-meta), another tiny meta.<br>
- [See Also
](https://crosshare.org/crosswords/6Yx1QZVGoGnbLx1QebnK/see-also), though not strictly a meta, is meta-adjacent.<br>
