I publish American-style crosswords on my [Crosshare](https://crosshare.org/noneuclidean) blog.

I've also made two variety cryptic crosswords:

[Moving Parts](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IPii82pM4GkUHKyTvHyLOKIUWPEtysIAF4_5ez1BHu8/edit#gid=19501955)


[Manual Labors](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EN2Jqa0iNRoNCxo4YyrqDip_PK1NRPmyA2olW0Kh-48/edit#gid=1893055120) (created for Timwi as part of a Secret Santa puzzle exchange)

They're both fairly difficult, so feel free to contact me for hints!
